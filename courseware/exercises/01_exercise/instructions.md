## Steps

1. Copy the `begin.py` file to a new file named `app.py`.

2. Update the class named `BankAccount` with the following attributes:
   - `account_number` (private): a string representing the account number
   - `balance` (private): a float representing the account balance

3. Implement a constructor (`__init__` method) that initializes the `account_number` and `balance` attributes.

4. Define getter and setter methods for the `account_number` and `balance` attributes.

5. Implement the existing method named `deposit` to add the parameter `amount` to the account balance.

6. Implement the existing method named `withdraw` to subtract the parameter `amount` from the account balance.

7. Instantiate an object of the `BankAccount` class and test the implemented methods.
