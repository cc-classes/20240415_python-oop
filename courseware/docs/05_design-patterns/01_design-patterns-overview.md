## Introduction to Design Patterns

Design Patterns are general reusable solutions to common problems that occur during software development. They aren’t blueprints or templates, but rather guidelines for how to structure code to solve certain types of problems. Design patterns can help improve the modularity, reusability, and readability of your code.

## Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are typically grouped into three main categories: Creational, Behavioral, and Structural.

### 1. **Creational Patterns**

#### Overview:
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns abstract the instantiation process, making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

#### Patterns Include:
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Similar to Factory Method, but here a family of related or dependent objects is created without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Define an interface for creating an object, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Builder Pattern**: Allows constructing a complex object step by step, often used for objects with many optional components or configurations.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point to access it.

#### Example:
Using a Factory Method to create different types of accounts in a banking application, abstracting the creation logic from the client code.

### 2. **Behavioral Patterns**

#### Overview:
Behavioral patterns deal with object collaboration and the delegation of responsibilities among objects. These patterns describe patterns of communication between objects.

#### Patterns Include:
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Passes the request along a chain of potential handlers until an object handles it.
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization, queuing of requests, and logging of the operations.
- **Interpreter Pattern**: Defines a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
- **Iterator Pattern**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator Pattern**: Reduces the connections between communicating objects, thereby reducing coupling and simplifying updates to the system.
- **Observer Pattern**: A one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows selecting an algorithm’s implementation at runtime.
- **Memento Pattern**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so the object can be restored to this state later.
- **State Pattern**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Template Method Pattern**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Visitor Pattern**: Adds further operations to objects without having to modify them.

#### Example:
Using the Observer Pattern to implement an event handling system, where events are sent to observers for handling.

### 3. **Structural Patterns**

#### Overview:
Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn’t need to change along with it.

#### Patterns Include:
- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. This makes one class look like another class by providing a wrapper around it.
- **Bridge Pattern**: Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.
- **Composite Pattern**: Allows individual objects and composites (group of objects) to be treated uniformly.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Adds new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

#### Example:
Using the Adapter Pattern to integrate a third-party library into your application, without changing the library's code.

## Conclusion

Design patterns provide solutions to common software design problems, and can help make your code more efficient, scalable, and maintainable. Understanding these patterns and knowing when and how to apply them is an essential skill for software developers.
