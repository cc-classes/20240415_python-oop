### Course Description

This comprehensive course on Object-Oriented Python Programming is designed for individuals who want to delve deep into Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) features and concepts. Participants will explore the foundational principles of OOP including Python classes, class inheritance, SOLID programming principles, and design patterns. The course provides hands-on experience and practical projects, ensuring participants can apply OOP concepts effectively in their future programming projects.

### What You'll Learn

Upon completion of the Object-Oriented Python Programming course, participants will be able to:

1. **Understand the Core Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming:**
   - Grasp the fundamental concepts of OOP and how they are implemented in Python.
   
2. **Create and Utilize Python Classes and Objects:**
   - Write Python classes and create objects to model real-world entities, and understand concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
   
3. **Implement Class Inheritance:**
   - Design and implement inherited classes to promote code reusability and organization.
   
4. **Apply SOLID Principles:**
   - Understand and apply the five SOLID design principles to create robust, maintainable, and scalable Python programs.
   
5. **Utilize Design Patterns:**
   - Implement common design patterns to solve complex problems more efficiently and effectively.

## Local Environment Packages

If you choose to not use a Virtual Machine, you will need to create a local Python environment with the following packages. No support is provided for local setups.
