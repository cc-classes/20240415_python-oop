## Interface Segregation Principle

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is the fourth of the SOLID principles. It states that no client should be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In essence, rather than having one large interface, it is better to have several smaller, more specific interfaces.

ISP is particularly crucial in statically typed languages like Java or C# where interfaces are explicit. However, Python, being a dynamically typed language, doesn't have formal interfaces. Still, the principle can apply to abstract base classes or even to the design and organization of methods in regular classes.

## Why Use ISP?

- Reduces the side-effects and frequency of interface changes. If an interface has many methods that cater to different clients, changes to one method might require changes to many clients.
- Enhances system organization and maintainability by decoupling.
- Improves clarity and specificity.

## ISP Example

Consider a scenario where you have an interface for managing user operations in a system.

### Without Applying ISP:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class UserManager(ABC):
    
    @abstractmethod
    def add_user(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def delete_user(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def generate_report(self):
        pass

class AdminUserManager(UserManager):
    def add_user(self):
        print("User added")

    def delete_user(self):
        print("User deleted")

    def generate_report(self):
        print("Report generated")

class ClientUserManager(UserManager):
    def add_user(self):
        # Not relevant for this client
        pass

    def delete_user(self):
        # Not relevant for this client
        pass

    def generate_report(self):
        print("Report for client generated")
```

In this scenario, the `ClientUserManager` is forced to implement (or at least stub out) the `add_user` and `delete_user` methods, even if they are not relevant. This violates the ISP.

### Applying ISP:

To adhere to the Interface Segregation Principle, you should segregate the `UserManager` interface into smaller, more specific interfaces:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class UserOperations(ABC):
    
    @abstractmethod
    def add_user(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def delete_user(self):
        pass

class ReportGeneration(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def generate_report(self):
        pass

class AdminUserManager(UserOperations, ReportGeneration):
    def add_user(self):
        print("User added")

    def delete_user(self):
        print("User deleted")

    def generate_report(self):
        print("Report generated")

class ClientReportManager(ReportGeneration):

    def generate_report(self):
        print("Report for client generated")
```

In the refactored code:

- We've broken down the `UserManager` into two smaller interfaces: `UserOperations` and `ReportGeneration`.
- `AdminUserManager` implements both interfaces since admins need all functionalities.
- `ClientReportManager` only implements `ReportGeneration` as it's the only relevant interface for clients.

This way, you ensure that a class only implements the methods it requires, adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle. Even in a dynamically typed language like Python, this approach leads to cleaner, more maintainable, and more understandable code.
